## My Solution

```
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000
```

## Reflection

This problem was pretty simple to solve given you know the syntax. Apart from syntax,
the only other keys to note were that we should use `OR` because only 1 of the 2 criteria need to be met, and using the `>=` instead of just `>` because we want comparison to be inclusive of those round numbers.
