## My Solution

```
WITH tempData AS (
SELECT id, temperature, recordDate,
LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prevTemp,
LAG(recordDate) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prevDate
FROM Weather
)
SELECT id from tempData
WHERE temperature > prevTemp AND DATE_ADD(prevDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = recordDate
```

## Reflection

This problem was really challenging. I had to reference a bunch of different SQL docs to learn about `Common Table Expressions (CTE)` as well as the `LAG` and `ADD_BY` functions. With that being said, I learned a ton and definitely improved my SQL skills in the process.
