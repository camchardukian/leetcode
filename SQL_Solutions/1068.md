## Reflection

I've been feeling a bit burnt out so I took a Friday and the rest of the weekend off. Prior to my long weekend, however, I racked up a 31 day streak on Leetcode.

Sometimes you get off track or just need to refresh for a few days and that's ok. I do appreciate the consistency I had during that streak, and the time I stepped away from the computer for a few days was well earned.

We'll try to get back into the swing of things again now.

Today I solved a SQL JOIN problem. I used the keyword `USING` instead of `ON` because the two columns we wanted to join had the same name so it's better to use `USING` for simplicity.
