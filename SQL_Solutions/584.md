## My Solution

```
SELECT name from CUSTOMER where referee_id <> 2 OR referee_id is null
```

## Reflection

I find it interesting that we need to manually add the condition for selecting when `referee_id` is equal to null. On that note, it's also interesting that we use the `is` keyword instead of just checking `referee_id` is equal to `null` using the equals operator.

I know these are some of the most introductory problems, but SQL doesn't seem too difficult. It just seems like learning it will require knowing why you want to select what you want to select and then familiarizing yourself with the syntax.
