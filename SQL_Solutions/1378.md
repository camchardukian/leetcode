## My Solution

```
SELECT EmployeeUNI.unique_id, Employees.name
FROM EmployeeUNI
RIGHT JOIN Employees ON EmployeeUNI.id = Employees.id;
```

## Reflection

Yikes, I just got humbled after saying SQL was so easy. I know joins conceptually are not that complex, but my first time working with them they're taking quite a lot of focus trying to consider which columns to select and which way to join from.

I think after 2-3 more problems on them, I'll be ok though.
