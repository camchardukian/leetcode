## My Solution

```
SELECT name, bonus
FROM Employee
LEFT JOIN Bonus USING (empId)
WHERE bonus IS NULL OR bonus < 1000
```

## Reflection

I'm getting the feeling SQL is somewhat like RegEx in that it's something practically speaking you're more likely to look up as needed rather than trying to become a super wizard at it and memorizing everything so that you can type from muscle memory.

That doesn't seem necessary, and especially given that I'm more focused on frontend I'll probably solve another handful of problems before getting back to solving regular Leetcode problems again.
