## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {number}
 */
var sumOfTheDigitsOfHarshadNumber = function(x) {
    const sumOfDigits = x.toString().split("").reduce((a, b) => Number(a) + Number(b));
    return x % sumOfDigits ? -1 : sumOfDigits;
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was solid I think. I could have possibly switched up the usage of `Number` with the unary `+` operator, but that just would've been a stylistic choice for conciseness.

I think my logic was ok.
