## Solution

/\*\*

- @param {string} s
- @return {string}
  \*/
  var reverseWords = function(s) {
  s = s.split(" ");
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
  s[i] = s[i].split("").reverse().join("");
  }
  return s.join(" ");
  };

## Reflection

This was another problem I took on to try to drill two pointers, but again the two pointers didn't seem strictly necessary here because the built-in JS functions still allowed me to solve the problem.

Upon further review, however, it seems that using two pointers may have allowed me to have better space complexity because two pointers allow for reversing the string in place versus the built-in JS functions having to create a new array and new string.
