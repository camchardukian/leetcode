## My solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @param {character} ch
 * @return {string}
 */
var reversePrefix = function(word, ch) {
    let l = 0;
    let r = word.indexOf(ch);
    let myWord = ''
    if (r === -1) {
        return word;
    } else {
        myWord+=word[r];
        l = r - 1;
        for (let i = l; i >= 0; i--) {
            myWord+=word[i]
        }
        for (let i = r + 1; i < word.length; i++) {
            myWord+=word[i]
        }
        return myWord;
    }
};
```

## Reflection

I tried to work on this problem to get a better idea of how two pointers work. I don't think it was strictly necessary to use two pointers here and I might've been able to write simpler code if I used the native split, join, reverse functions, but at least we got the basics of the two pointer concept.
