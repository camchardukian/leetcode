## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var returnToBoundaryCount = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 1) {
        return nums[0] === 0 ? 1 : 0;
    }
    let sum = nums[0];
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
        if (sum === 0) {
            count+=1;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was generally good but it could have been made better.

I should have read the constraints more clearly because in the last line they mentioned that `nums[i]` would not equal 0.
