## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {number}
 */
var findLucky = function(arr) {
    const numberMap = new Map();
    arr.forEach((num) => {
        numberMap.set(num, (numberMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    })
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)
    for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (numberMap.get(arr[i]) === arr[i]) {
            return arr[i];
        }
    }
    return -1;
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was on the right track. I was right to use a hash map. In the end, however, the time complexity of my solution was poor because I unnecessarily sorted through the array.

Instead, I should have run a forEach loop on the map and used logic that looked something like this:

```
var findLucky = function(arr) {
    const numberMap = new Map();

    // Build frequency map
    arr.forEach(num => {
        numberMap.set(num, (numberMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    });

    let largestLucky = -1;

    // Iterate over the map to find the largest lucky number
    numberMap.forEach((count, num) => {
        if (count === num) {
            largestLucky = Math.max(largestLucky, num);
        }
    });

    return largestLucky;
};
```

I think I wasn't able to come up with this optimized logic yet because I'm still fairly new to using maps and I wasn't aware I could run a forEach loop on a Map. Now I am though, so next time I'm in a similar situation I'll be better prepared.
