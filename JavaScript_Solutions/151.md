## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var reverseWords = function (s) {
    const sentence = s.trim().split(/\s+/);
    let l = 0;
    let lSpaces = 0;
    let r = sentence.length - 1;
    let rSpaces = 0;

    while (l < r) {
        [sentence[l], sentence[r]] = [sentence[r], sentence[l]];
        l++;
        r--;
    }
    return sentence.join(" ");
};
```

## Reflection

The key to this problem was realizing we could use the `.split()` method with a regular expression to remove excess spaces from within the middle of the string.

We then can use `.trim()` to remove extra spaces from the beginning and end of the string. Once that's done, we can either use a two pointer approach or the `.reverse()` method to reverse the array before joining and returning it.

I used a two pointer approach because that's what I'm used to when solving this kind of problem but honestly using the _reverse_ method probably would have made more sense as both have similar performance.
