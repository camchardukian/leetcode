## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @param {number} t

 */
var theMaximumAchievableX = function(num, t) {
    return num + (t * 2)
};
```

## Reflection

This problem's description was not well written so I had to read it several times to understand what the problem was asking for.

Once I understood what we were looking to do, however, I was able to solve the problem in a minute or so with just one line of code.
