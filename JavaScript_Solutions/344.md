## My solution

```
/**
 * @param {character[]} s
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
 */
var reverseString = function(s) {
    let l = 0;
    let r = s.length - 1;
    while (l < r) {
        const tempStorage = s[r]
        s[r] = s[l];
        s[l] = tempStorage;
        l++;
        r--;
    }
};
```

## Reflection

It seems like my solution was already ideal from a time/space complexity standpoint, but it's arguable that using array destructuring could've been a slightly more elegant solution vs using a temporary variable:

```
var reverseString = function(s) {
    let l = 0;
    let r = s.length - 1;
    while (l < r) {
        [s[l], s[r]] = [s[r], s[l]];
        l++;
        r--;
    }
};
```
