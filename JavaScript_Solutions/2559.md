## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {number[][]} queries
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var vowelStrings = function (words, queries) {
    const prefixSum = new Array(words.length + 1).fill(0);
    const vowels = new Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        if (vowels.has(words[i][0]) && vowels.has(words[i][words[i].length - 1])) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + 1
        } else {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i]
        }
    }
    const output = [];
    for (query of queries) {
        output.push(prefixSum[query[1] + 1] - prefixSum[query[0]])
    }
    return output;
};
```

## Reflection

I recognized within a minute or so of reading the problem that this was going to be a prefix sum problem.

Due to having solved relatively few prefix sum problems in the past, this problem took me a solid 35-40 minutes to solve even though I knew I knew the solution conceptually I still faced some syntax and off by 1 errors.

Eventually I produced an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n+q) where `n` is the length of words and `q` is the number of queries.
