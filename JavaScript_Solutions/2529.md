## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumCount = function (nums) {
    let min = 0;
    let max = nums.length - 1;
    let mid;
    while (min <= max) {
        mid = Math.floor((min + max) / 2)
        if (nums[mid] < 0) {
            min = mid + 1;
        } else {
            max = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    const negs = min;

    min = 0;
    max = nums.length - 1;
    mid = 0;

    while (min <= max) {
        mid = Math.floor((min + max) / 2)
        if (nums[mid] > 0) {
            max = mid - 1;
        } else {
            min = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    const pos = nums.length - min
    return Math.max(negs, pos)

};
```

## Reflection

While this problem technically has a really low ELO rating (1195), I still found it fairly time consuming to work through.

The good thing, however, is I continued to get comfortable with binary search and this time was able to combine the results of two different binary searches to get an answer.
