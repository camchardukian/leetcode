## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isFascinating = function (n) {
    const numbers = new Set();
    const setNumbers = (num) => {
        while (num > 0) {
            let current = num % 10
            if (numbers.has(current) || current === 0) {
                return false;
            }
            numbers.add(current);
            num = Math.floor(num / 10);
        }
        return true;
    }
    return setNumbers(n) && setNumbers(n * 2) && setNumbers(n * 3) && numbers.size === 9
};
```

## Reflection

While it isn't as readable I choose to solve this problem using manual digit extraction for practice and because theoretically this type of solution should have a faster execution time than if our solution were to include string conversion.
