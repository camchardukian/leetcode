## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} cardPoints
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxScore = function (cardPoints, k) {
    let current = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        current += cardPoints[i];
    }
    let max = current;
    let r = cardPoints.length - 1;
    for (let l = k - 1; l >= 0; l--) {
        current -= cardPoints[l];
        current += cardPoints[r];
        max = Math.max(current, max);
        r--;
    }
    return max;
};
```

## Reflection

The ELO rating for this problem is 1573, making it one of the most difficult problems I've solved, and probably the most difficult problem I've produced an optimal solution for.

My solution uses the sliding window technique, but the thing that makes this problem a bit more challenging than a normal sliding window technique problem is the need to use the two pointer technique as well (to remove items from the left and add items from the right).
