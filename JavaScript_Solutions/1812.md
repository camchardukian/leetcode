## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} coordinates
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var squareIsWhite = function(coordinates) {
    coordinates = coordinates.replace(/[bdfh]/, "2");
    coordinates = coordinates.replace(/[aceg]/, "1");
    return (parseInt(coordinates[0]) + parseInt(coordinates[1])) % 2 ? true : false;
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was decent, but there's two ways I could have made it more efficient. One would have been by using charCodes instead of regex and string replacements.

Another would have been to return the result of the remainder operation directly like this `blah blah % 2 !== 0` instead of using a ternary.

Overall, still a decent attempt and simpler than the approach I took in the contest last week.
