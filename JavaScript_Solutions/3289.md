## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var getSneakyNumbers = function(nums) {
    const numberMap = new Map();
    const output = [];
    for (num of nums) {
        numberMap.set(num, (numberMap.get(num) || 0) + 1)
        if (numberMap.get(num) > 1) {
            output.push(num);
        }
        if (output.length === 2) {
            return output;
        }
    }
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was reasonably good, and as it was Q1 of this week's leetcode contest I'm happy to only have taken ~3.5 minutes to implement this solution.

With that being said, I think using a `Set` would have been slightly simpler than using a `Map`. Overall though, I'm still happy with the solid solution I was able to produce in just a few minutes.
