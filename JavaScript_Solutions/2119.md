## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSameAfterReversals = function(num) {
    function reverse(num) {
    let result = 0;
    let multiplier = 1;
      while (num > 0) {
        addend = num % 10;
        result*=10;
        result+=addend;
        num = Math.floor(num / 10);
      }
      return result;
    }
    const reverse1 = reverse(num);
    return num === reverse(reverse1);
};
```

## Reflection

While my solution worked, virtually all of my logic was unnecessary. We didn't need to reverse the number at all.

All we really needed to do was check to see if `num` was 0, or had trailing zeros. Our solution could have been as simple as this:

```
var isSameAfterReversals = function(num) {
    // If num is 0, the result will always be true.
    // Otherwise, if it has trailing zeros, it won't be the same after double reversal.
    return num === 0 || num % 10 !== 0;
};
```
