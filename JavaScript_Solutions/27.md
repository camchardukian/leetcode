## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} val
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeElement = function(nums, val) {
    for (let i = nums.length; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (nums[i] === val) {
            nums.splice(i, 1);
        }
    }
    return nums.length
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was functional, but it would've been more efficient from a time/space complexity perspective to use the two pointer technique.

I could have used one pointer to loop through the array and used a second pointer to keep track of where the 'non-value' items (meaning the items we should keep) should be placed.
