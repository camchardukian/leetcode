## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var dominantIndex = function(nums) {
    let max = 0;
    let index = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > max) {
            max = nums[i]
            index = i
        }
    }
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (max / num < 2 && max / num !== 1) {
            return -1;
        }
    }
    return index;
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was ok, but it would've been more efficient to add an extra variable to store the second largest value as well. By doing so, I could've avoided having to loop over the array an extra time.
