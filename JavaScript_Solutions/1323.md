## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximum69Number  = function(num) {
    return Number(String(num).replace('6', '9'))
};
```

## Reflection

This problem was really simple but initially I tried to be too clever and reverse the integer manually using the modulus operator and pushing it into an array. This was totally unneccesary, I should've just went with my initial idea of converting to a string and replacing the first occurence of 6.
