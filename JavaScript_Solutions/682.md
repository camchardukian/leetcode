## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
var calPoints = function(operations) {
    const stack = [];
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
        if (operations[i] === "C") {
            count-= stack[stack.length - 1];
            stack.pop();
        } else if (operations[i] === "D") {
            const product = stack[stack.length - 1] * 2;
            stack.push(product)
            count+=product;
        } else if (operations[i] === "+") {
            const sum = stack[stack.length - 1] + stack[stack.length - 2]
            stack.push(sum)
            count+=sum
        } else {
            stack.push(Number(operations[i]))
            count+=Number(operations[i])
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Reflection

I think my solution was fairly good, but I could combine the popping operation and the subtraction operation as popping returns a value.

I could also set the operation[i] string to a variable when converting it to a number, that way I only need to perform the `Number` conversion once.

That change may have a negligible effect on performance depending on how the browser's JS engine is interpreting the code.
