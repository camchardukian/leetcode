## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let profit = 0;
    let prev = prices[0]
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] > prev) {
            profit += prices[i] - prev
        }
        prev = prices[i]
    }
    return profit;
};
```

## Reflection

I got an optimal `O(n)` solution for this problem, but I honestly could have done even better if I'd gotten rid of the variable `prev`. That variable was completely unnecessary.

In any case, another medium down the drain. Another step closer to continuing to get more comfortable with mediums and being able to solve 2/4 problems in the weekly contests.
