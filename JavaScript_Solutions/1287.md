## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {number}
 */
var findSpecialInteger = function(arr) {
    const numberMap = new Map();
    const fourth = (arr.length / 4) +.001 ;
    for (num of arr) {
        numberMap.set(num, (numberMap.get(num) || 0) + 1)
        if (numberMap.get(num) >= fourth) {
            return num
        }
    }
};
```

## Reflection

Taking care of some personal life stuff today so my mind isn't in the best state to tackle problems.

I think that's why my solution was a bit sloppy.

I could have improved the space/time complexity a bit by doing a linear scan strategy instead of using Map.

A better solution would've looked something like this:

```
var findSpecialInteger = function(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    const threshold = Math.floor(n / 4);

    let count = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === arr[i - 1]) {
            count++;
        } else {
            count = 1; // reset count for a new element
        }

        if (count > threshold) {
            return arr[i];
        }
    }

    // If the input is valid, we should never reach here
    return arr[0];
};
```
