## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var sumOfSquares = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i === 0) {
            sum += Math.pow(nums[i - 1], 2);
        }
    }

    return sum;
};
```

## Reflection

I didn't like this question. It was poorly written and a nightmare to understand relative to how difficult it should have been. Thumbs down.
