## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} celsius
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var convertTemperature = function(celsius) {
    return [celsius + 273.15, celsius * 1.80 + 32.00]
};
```

## Reflection

I'm not sure why, but I feel mentally exhausted today. This problem was so simple as to be a waste of time, but at least I kept up my streak with Leetcode.
