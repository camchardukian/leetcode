## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} purchaseAmount
 * @return {number}
 */
var accountBalanceAfterPurchase = function (purchaseAmount) {
    return 100 - (Math.round(purchaseAmount / 10) * 10);
};
```

## Reflection

I'm not sure if this problem is more difficult in other languages with multiple ways of representing integer values, but in JS it was dead simple to write an optimized solution.
