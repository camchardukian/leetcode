## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[][]} brackets
 * @param {number} income
 * @return {number}
 */
var calculateTax = function (brackets, income) {
    let taxedIncome = 0;
    let taxesPaid = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
        const taxableIncome = brackets[i][0] - taxedIncome;
        if (taxableIncome + taxedIncome >= income) {
            taxesPaid += (income - taxedIncome) * brackets[i][1] / 100;
            return taxesPaid;
        }
        taxedIncome += taxableIncome;
        taxesPaid += (taxableIncome * brackets[i][1]) / 100
    }
    return taxesPaid;
};
```

## Reflection

I haven't done a leetcode problem in several days because I got really sick from food poisoning.

My mental clarity is still bad, this problem took me 45 to solve whereas I think normally it may have taken me 15 minutes or less. Oh well.

At least we're building the habit again. Hopefully in the next day or two my brain will start working normally again and I won't feel as fatigued.
