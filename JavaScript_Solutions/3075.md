## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} happiness
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumHappinessSum = function(happiness, k) {
    let sum = 0;
    let penalty = 0;
    happiness.sort((a, b) => b - a)
    for (child of happiness) {
        sum += Math.max(child - penalty, 0)
        k--;
        if (k === 0) {
            return sum;
        }
        penalty++;
    }
};
```

## Reflection

I had to reread the problem several times to understand what they were asking, but once I gained clarity on what they were actually looking for writing the code itself wasn't very challenging.

This solution is `O(n log n)` because of the sorting and is the best simple solution.

I'm not sure if an `O(n)` solution exists using something like a priority queue, but I guess I'll learn more about that in the future as I continue to improve my DSA knowledge.
