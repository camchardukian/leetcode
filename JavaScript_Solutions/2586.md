## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {number} left
 * @param {number} right
 * @return {number}
 */
var vowelStrings = function(words, left, right) {
    const regex = /[aeiou]/;
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        if (regex.test(words[i][0]) && regex.test(words[i][words[i].length - 1])) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

## Reflection

It seems like the time complexity of my solution was ok, but it would've been better performing if I would've used JavaScript `Sets` instead of Regex.
