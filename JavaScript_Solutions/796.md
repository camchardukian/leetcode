## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} goal
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var rotateString = function(s, goal) {
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        s = s.slice(1) + s[0];
        if (s === goal) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
};
```

## Reflection

I was able to find an `O(n^2)` solution but there were some smarter solutions from the community that used Regex or the the JavaScript `.includes()` method for a more efficient `O(n)` solution.
