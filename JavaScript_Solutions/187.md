## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var findRepeatedDnaSequences = function(s) {
    if (s.length < 11) {
        return [];
    }
    const seen = new Set();
    const seenRepeated = new Set();
    for (let i = 0; i + 9 < s.length; i++) {
        let current = s.substring(i, i + 10)
        if (seen.has(current)) {
            seenRepeated.add(current)
        } else {
            seen.add(current)
        }
    }
    return [...seenRepeated]
};
```

## Reflection

If you look at my history, you'll see that for the last couple months I've mostly done 1 problem per day.

I figured that if I did lots of the easiest problems on leetcode I would gradually improve my problem solving skills and ability to produce optimal solutions.

That has definitely been the case. I think by solving one problem per day I'm also able to keep improving while still having time to focus on my job and learning other industry skills via classes on topics like networking, SQL, Java, etc.

Now that I've done a ton of easy problems (currently 176), I think another shift is in order.

During the week when I have less time I'll still do problems that I feel are easier to continue improving my speed and muscle memory.

On weekends, however, is when I'll dive deeper into higher difficulty problems and new techniques.

By combining these two approaches I should be able to continue increasing my problem solving speed, but more importantly increase the diversity and difficulty of problems I'm able to handle.
