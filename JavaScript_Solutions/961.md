## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var repeatedNTimes = function (nums) {
    const numberMap = new Map();
    for (num of nums) {
        numberMap.set(num, (numberMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
        if (numberMap.get(num) === nums.length / 2) {
            return num;
        }
    }
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was reasonably good, but if I would have read the description more carefully I would've realized that all numbers were unique except for the 1 number being repeated.

I incorrectly assumed any numbers could be repeated, but we were just looking for a certain number that was repeated `nums.length / 2` times.

If I read more carefully, I would've realized that using a `Map` could've produced a cleaner solution than a `Set` here.
