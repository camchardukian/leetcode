## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var toLowerCase = function (s) {
    let output = s;
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s.charCodeAt(i) <= 90 && s.charCodeAt(i) >= 65) {
            output = output.slice(0, i) + String.fromCharCode(s.charCodeAt(i) + 32) + output.slice(i + 1)
        }
    }
    return output;
};
```

## Reflection

While this problem could easily be solved using a built-in function like `.toLowerCase()`, that clearly wasn't the learning objective here.

As such, I solved the problem instead using character codes and adding 32 to the codes to replace capital letters with lowercase letters. This unfortunately did come with the drawback that each time I replaced a letter I was also creating a new string.

In summary, while my solution worked, I could've gone another step further to optimize my solution by pushing values to an array and later joining the array items as a string.
