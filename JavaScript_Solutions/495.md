## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} timeSeries
 * @param {number} duration
 * @return {number}
 */
var findPoisonedDuration = function(timeSeries, duration) {
    let seconds = 0;
    let prev = timeSeries[0]
    for (let i = 1; i < timeSeries.length; i++) {
        const timePassed = timeSeries[i] - prev;
        if (timePassed < duration) {
            seconds+= timePassed
        } else {
            seconds+=duration;
        }
        prev = timeSeries[i]
    }
    return seconds + duration;
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was mostly optimal, but I could've simplified the logic a bit by using `seconds+=Math.min(timePassed, duration)` instead of using an if/else. Beyond that, however, I think the solution's time/space complexity is optimal.
