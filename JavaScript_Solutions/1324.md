## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var printVertically = function (s) {
    const words = s.split(" ");
    let longestWordLength = 0;
    for (let word of words) {
        longestWordLength = Math.max(word.length, longestWordLength);
    };
    const output = Array.from({ length: longestWordLength }, () => []);
    for (word of words) {
        for (let i = 0; i < longestWordLength; i++) {
            if (i < word.length) {
                output[i].push(word[i])
            }
            else {
                output[i].push(' ')
            }
        }
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < output.length; i++) {
        output[i] = output[i].join("").trimEnd()
    }
    return output
};
```

## Reflection

This problem was a mess. The time complexity is super complex because I'm looping, looping, splitting, joining, etc.

Overall I'll just call this the brute force solution and cut my losses.

What this problem did teach me, however, was a weird quirk about JavaScript.

I learned that if we pass an array like this: `const output = new Array(longestWordLength).fill([]);` it causes all of the inner-arrays to be pointing to the same reference array.

This means if we modify one of the inner arrays, all of them will be updated! Not knowing that was the biggest reason this problem took me a fairly long time to solve.
