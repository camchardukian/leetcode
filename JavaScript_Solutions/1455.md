## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} strs
 * @return {string}
 */
var isPrefixOfWord = function(sentence, searchWord) {
    const words = sentence.split(" ");
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        if (words[i].substring(0, searchWord.length) === searchWord) {
            return i + 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was pretty good, but in retrospect it could have been simplified a bit. Instead of using `.substring()`, I could have used `.startsWith()`.
