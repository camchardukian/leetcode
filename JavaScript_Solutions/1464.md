## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProduct = function(nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    return (nums[0] - 1) * (nums[1] - 1);
};
```

## Reflection

While my solution was concise and simple, I now understand that it wasn't the most time efficient.

After doing some research, I found out that sorting algorithms are generally O(n log n) complexity whereas I could've solved this problem in linear time if I had used a normal looping solution.
