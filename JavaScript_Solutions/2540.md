## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @return {number}
 */
var getCommon = function (nums1, nums2) {
    let p1 = 0;
    let p2 = 0;

    while (p1 < nums1.length && p2 < nums2.length) {
        if (nums1[p1] === nums2[p2]) {
            return nums1[p1]
        } else if (nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]) {
            p2++
        } else {
            p1++
        }
    }
    return -1;
};
```

## Reflection

I think my solution was optimal. While I think I technically could have solved this problem with binary search, this really seemed like more of a two pointer solution kind of problem to me.
