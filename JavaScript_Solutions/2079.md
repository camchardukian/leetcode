## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} plants
 * @param {number} capacity
 * @return {number}
 */
var wateringPlants = function (plants, capacity) {
    let water = capacity;
    let steps = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < plants.length; i++) {
        if (water < plants[i]) {
            steps += (2 * i) + 1
            water = capacity - plants[i]
        } else {
            water -= plants[i]
            steps += 1
        }
    }
    return steps;
};
```

## Reflection

There weren't any special tricks to solve this problem. Just thinking over the logic and doing some algebra so that we could eventually come up with an O(n) solution.
