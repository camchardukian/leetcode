## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var countSegments = function (s) {
    return s.split(" ").filter((item) => !!item).length
};
```

## Reflection

This problem was pretty straightforward. The one edge case I successfully anticipated, but I think would have been easy to miss is the case where there are multiple consecutive spaces. My solution addressed this concern, and I believe my solution was optimal from a time complexity perspective.
