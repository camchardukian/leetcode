## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
    let maxProfit = 0;
    let minPrice = prices[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] > minPrice) {
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minPrice)
        } else if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
            minPrice = prices[i]
        }
    }
    return maxProfit
};
```

## Reflection

While it's one of the easiest Sliding Window problems on Leetcode, it feels good to knock off another problem from the Neetcode 150.

I'm now 13/150 problems through the list. Not even 10% done, but I've learned some cool techniques thus far.

I bet by the time I get a third or halfway through I'll be able to consistently solve 2/4 problems in the weekly contests.

That's a good medium-term goal to shoot for.
