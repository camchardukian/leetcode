## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
 */
var moveZeroes = function (nums) {
    let l = 0;
    let r = 0;

    while (r < nums.length) {
        if (!nums[l] === 0) {
            l++;
            continue;
        }
        if (nums[r] === 0) {
            r++;
            continue;
        }
        [nums[l], nums[r]] = [nums[r], nums[l]]
        l++;
        r++;
    }
    return nums;
};

```

## Reflection

My solution's time and space complexity were optimal, but I probably could have made the logic a bit clearer and more concise if I would've done a for loop plus an outside variable like `lastNonZeroFoundAt` instead of using two explicit left and right pointers.

In any case, things still went pretty well overall.
