## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var uniqueOccurrences = function (arr) {
    const occurrences = new Map();

    for (let num of arr) {
        occurrences.set(num, (occurrences.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }

    const uniqueOccurrences = new Set();

    for (let count of occurrences.values()) {
        if (uniqueOccurrences.has(count)) {
            return false;
        }
        uniqueOccurrences.add(count);
    }

    return true;
};
```

## Reflection

After solving this problem, I conversed with ChatGPT about my solution and found it interesting to hear that my O(2n) solution would still be considered an O(n) solution because its time complexity is linear.
