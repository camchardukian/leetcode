## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {character[]} letters
 * @param {character} target
 * @return {character}
 */
var nextGreatestLetter = function(letters, target) {
    const targetCode = target.charCodeAt()
    for (letter of letters) {
        if (letter.charCodeAt() > targetCode) {
            return letter
        }
    }
    return letters[0]
};
```

## Reflection

I quickly came to this functional solution above which runs in O(n) time, but I could've came up with a more efficient solution if I spent more time thinking about this problem.

In reality, because the input array is already sorted, it would've made more sense to use a binary search approach rather than looping through every element of the input array.

Oh well, at least that's a reminder to at least consider using binary search for input arrays that come already sorted.

An optimal solution would've looked something like this:

```
var nextGreatestLetter = function(letters, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = letters.length - 1;

    // If the target is greater than or equal to the last letter, return the first letter.
    if (target >= letters[right]) {
        return letters[0];
    }

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (letters[mid] > target) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return letters[left];
};
```
