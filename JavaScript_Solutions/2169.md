## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} num1
 * @param {number} num2
 * @return {number}
 */
var countOperations = function (num1, num2) {
    let count = 0;
    while (num1 !== 0 && num2 !== 0) {
        if (num1 >= num2) {
            num1 = num1 - num2;
        } else {
            num2 = num2 - num1
        }
        count++;
    }
    return count
};
```

## Reflection

My solution worked, but it wasn't the most efficient solution because it didn't account for the possibility that the two numbers could be dramatically different sizes. If we had 7 million and 7 for example, we'd have to perform 1,000,000 operations.

If we instead used the modulus operator, however, we could use division to calculate the number of operations and either return the value if 0 was reaching or switch subtracting num1 from num2 and vice versa if necessary.
