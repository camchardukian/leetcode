## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {character}
 */
var repeatedCharacter = function(s) {
    const letters = new Map();
    for (char of s) {
        if (letters.has(char)) {
            return char;
        }
        letters.set(char, true);
    }
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was ok, but in retrospect it would have made more sense to use a `Set` to track unique occurences.
