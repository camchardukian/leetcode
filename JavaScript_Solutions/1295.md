## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findNumbers = function(nums) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (String(nums[i]).length % 2 === 0) {
            count+=1
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

## Reflection

I think my solution was solid and very readable. I thought the minor benefits in performance from the alternate solution of repeatedly dividing by 10 to count the digits wasn't worth the tradeoff of being harder to read.

However, I did find one genius solution that managed to complete this solution with O(n) time complexity:

```
var findNumbers = function(nums) {
  return nums.reduce((accum, curr) => accum + Math.floor(Math.log10(curr)) % 2, 0);
};
```
