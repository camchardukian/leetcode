## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function (s) {
    const letterMap = new Map();
    let l = 0;
    let r = 0;
    let max = 0;
    while (r < s.length) {
        if (!letterMap.get(s[r])) {
            letterMap.set(s[r], 1)
        } else {
            while (true) {
                if (s[l] !== s[r]) {
                    letterMap.set(s[l], 0);
                    l++;
                } else {
                    l++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        r++;
        max = Math.max(max, r - l)
    }
    return max;
};
```

## Reflection

It took me some time to think about the problem to conceptually figure out how I was going to tackle it.

Then, it took me even longer to code up the full solution.

In the end, however, I was able to get a pretty clean optimal solution!

Tackling two problems on Friday night is a great way to start the weekend!
