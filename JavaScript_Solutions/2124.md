## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var checkString = function(s) {
    return !s.includes("ba");
};
```

## Reflection

All we need to do is identify if there are an occurences of 'b' after 'a'. If so, we know to return false, otherwise return true.

This is worst case O(n) complexity which I think is an optimal solution for this problem.
