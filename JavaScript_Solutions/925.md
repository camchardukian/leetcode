## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} name
 * @param {string} typed
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isLongPressedName = function(name, typed) {
    let nPointer = 0;
    let tPointer = 0;
    while (tPointer < typed.length) {
        if (name[nPointer] === typed[tPointer]) {
            nPointer++;
            tPointer++
        } else if (nPointer === 0 || name[nPointer - 1] === typed[tPointer]) {
            tPointer++;
        }
        else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return nPointer === name.length;
};
```

## Reflection

While I didn't immediately know the answer to this problem, after thinking through things for a minute or two I realized we could use a two pointer solution. My solution should be optimal for time complexity.
