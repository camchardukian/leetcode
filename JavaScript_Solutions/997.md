## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} trust
 * @return {number}
 */
var findJudge = function (n, trust) {
    const personMap = new Map();
    const eliminated = new Set()
    if (n === 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    for (let person of trust) {
        personMap.set(person[1], (personMap.get(person[1]) || []).concat(person[0]))
        eliminated.add(person[0]);
    }

    for (const [key, value] of personMap) {
        if (value.length === n - 1 && !eliminated.has(key)) {
            return key
        }
    }
    return -1

};
```

## Reflection

I knew the solution would likely use a Hashmap but it seems like I overengineering this solution a bit because I didn't realize that a Hashmap becomes unnecessary for this problem given that each trust array would be unique.

So instead of a one to many relationship tracking who trusted each person, I could have instead simply counted the number of people that trusted each person as well as who they trusted.
