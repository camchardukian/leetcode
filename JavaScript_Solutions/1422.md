## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxScore = function (s) {
    const prefixSum = new Array(s.length).fill(0);
    prefixSum[s.length - 1] = s[s.length - 1] === '1' ? 1 : 0;
    for (let i = s.length - 2; i > 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] === '1') {
            prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i + 1] + 1
        } else {
            prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i + 1]
        }
    }
    let count = s[0] === "0" ? 1 : 0;
    let max = count + prefixSum[1];
    for (let i = 1; i < s.length - 1; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '0') {
            count++;
        }
        max = Math.max(max, count + prefixSum[i])
    }
    return max;
};
```

## Reflection

This preoblem required taking my prefix sum skills to another level as I was forced to loop backwards through the array and the maximum number of combinations was s.length - 1.

I eventually came up with a working solution but it took way longer than I would have liked as I kept having to deal with various 'off by 1' errors.

Oh well, I got some good practice in and I'll keep trying to improve my proficiency with prefix sum arrays.
