## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxOperations = function (nums, k) {
    const numberMap = new Map();
    let operationCount = 0;
    for (num of nums) {
        const difference = k - num;
        if (numberMap.get(difference) > 0) {
            numberMap.set(difference, (numberMap.get(difference) - 1));
            operationCount++;
        } else if (numberMap.has(num)) {
            numberMap.set(num, (numberMap.get(num) + 1))
        } else {
            numberMap.set(num, 1)
        }
    }
    return operationCount;
};
```

## My Pseudocode Before Typing Out My Solution

```

    // remove two numbers from `nums` whose sum equals `k`
    // return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

    // loop through array and check if key exists for (k - num) and value is greater than 0.
    // If so, decrement count for that key, and increment operationCount.
    // If not, add key for num and initalize value to 1, or if key already exists increment val.

```

## Reflection

I saw that this problem could be solved via sorting and two pointers, but I thought it would be more efficient to try to solve it in O(n) time by using a hashmap.
