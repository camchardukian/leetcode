## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfSpecialChars = function (word) {
    const codeSet = new Set();
    const letterSet = new Set()
    for (char of word) {
        const charCode = char.charCodeAt(0);
        if (charCode >= 65 && charCode <= 90) {
            codeSet.add(charCode)
        }
    }
    for (char of word) {
        const charCode = char.charCodeAt(0) - 32;
        if (charCode >= 65 && charCode <= 90 && codeSet.has(charCode)) {
            letterSet.add(char)
        }
    }
    return letterSet.size;
};
```

## Reflection

I recognized pretty quickly that I could use Sets to solve this problem. The only thing that tripped me up was that I expected to have to add 26 to go from lowercase to uppercase charCodes, but actually I needed to add 32 because they're are some misc codes between the lowercase and uppercase characters and to my surprise the uppercase codes are actually smaller numbers.

While my solution was pretty efficient, I could've actually solved this problem in a single iteration if I created two sets and checked conversions from lowercase to uppercase and vice versa rather than first getting all of the uppercase and only checking for lowercase later on.
