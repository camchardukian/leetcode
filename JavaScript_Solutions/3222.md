## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @param {number} y
 * @return {string}
 */
var losingPlayer = function(x, y) {
    let turn = 1;

    while (x > 0 && y > 0) {
        if (x >= 1) {
            x-=1;
        } else {
            break;
        }
        if (y >= 4) {
            y-=4;
        } else {
            break;
        }
        turn++;
    }
    return turn % 2 ? "Bob" : "Alice"
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was decent, but I think there was also a mathemematical formula that could've been used if we wanted to avoid looping, but I couldn't think of the right formula off the top of my head.
