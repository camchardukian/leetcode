## My solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}
 */
var mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {
    const length = word1.length > word2.length ? word1.length : word2.length
    let mergedString = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        if (word1[i]) {
            mergedString+=word1[i];
        }
        if (word2[i]) {
            mergedString+=word2[i];
        }
    }
    return mergedString;
};
```

## Reflection

I think my solution was good from a time/space complexity standpoint. I could have used `Math.max()` instead of the ternary operator for a slightly simpler solution, but in general I think this solution was very solid.
