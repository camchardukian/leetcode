## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMaxConsecutiveOnes = function (nums) {
    let count = 0;
    let max = 0;
    for (num of nums) {
        if (num === 1) {
            count++
        } else {
            count = 0;
        }
        max = Math.max(max, count);
    }
    return max;
};
```

## Reflection

This problem was pretty straightforward. It wasn't too much of a challenge to come up with a solution with an optimal time/space complexity.
