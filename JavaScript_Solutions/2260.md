## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} cards
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumCardPickup = function (cards) {
    const numbers = new Map();
    let minimumCount = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
        if (numbers.get(cards[i]) >= 0) {
            minimumCount = Math.min(minimumCount, (i - numbers.get(cards[i]) + 1));
        }
        numbers.set(cards[i], i)
    }
    if (minimumCount < Infinity) {
        return minimumCount;
    }
    return -1;
};
```

## Reflection

This problem has a few challenging edge cases, but once I got my head around the problem I was able to come to an optimal O(n) solution.
