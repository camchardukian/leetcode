## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isHappy = function(n) {
  let sum = 0;
  const seenSums = new Set();
  while (seenSums.has(sum) === false) {
    seenSums.add(sum);
    if (sum === 1) {
      return true;
    }
    let temp = sum || n;
    sum = 0;

    while (temp > 0) {
      const digit = temp % 10;
      sum += Math.pow(digit, 2);
      temp = Math.floor(temp / 10);
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```

## Reflection

It took me a lot of research about the modulus operator's ability to extract the last digit from a number as well as the idea to use Math.floor to effectively remove the last digit of a number in order to implement this solution.

Fortunately, next time I come across a similar problem I should be more prepared. I think my solution was decent, but I could have probably avoided the need to use a `temp` variable if I invested more time to think about the logic for the second `while` loop.
