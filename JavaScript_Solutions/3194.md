## My solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumAverage = function(nums) {
    nums.sort((a,b) => a - b);
    const averages = [];
    let l = 0;
    let r = nums.length - 1;
    while (l < r) {
        averages.push((nums[l] + nums[r]) / 2);
        l++;
        r--;
    }
    return averages.sort((a, b) => a - b)[0];
};
```

## Reflection

While my logic was correct and used two pointers, my original solution wasn't yet optimized. In reality, I didn't need to store the averages in a second array.

All I needed to do was perform the calculation of an individual average and then compare to see if that average was smaller than the previous minimum.

If I would've done that I could've avoided declaring an extra variable for the `averages` array and I also could've avoided having to sort the array before returning a final answer.
