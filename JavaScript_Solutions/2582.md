## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} time
 * @return {number}
 */
var passThePillow = function (n, time) {
    let remainder = time >= ((n - 1) * 2) ? time % ((n - 1) * 2) : time;
    let current = 1;
    let isIncreasing = true;
    while (remainder) {
        if (isIncreasing) {
            current++;
        } else {
            current--;
        }
        remainder--;
        if (current === n) {
            isIncreasing = false;
        } else if (current === 1) {
            isIncreasing = true;
        }
    }
    return current;
};
```

## Reflection

My solution correctly assumed that it wasn't necessary to simulate the entire process 1 by 1. I calculated the remainder and then looped through the remaining items meaning we'd never need to loop more than a full cycle length.

To further optimize my solution, however, I could have removed the looping entirely with some clever arithmetic:

```
var passThePillow = function (n, time) {
    const cycleLength = (n - 1) * 2; // The length of a full cycle
    const remainder = time % cycleLength; // Effective time within one cycle

    if (remainder <= n - 1) {
        // Forward direction
        return 1 + remainder;
    } else {
        // Backward direction
        return n - (remainder - (n - 1));
    }
};
```
