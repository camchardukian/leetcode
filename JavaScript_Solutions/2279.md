## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} capacity
 * @param {number[]} rocks
 * @param {number} additionalRocks
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumBags = function (capacity, rocks, additionalRocks) {
    const rocksNeeded = new Array(rocks.length).fill(0);
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < rocks.length; i++) {
        rocksNeeded[i] = capacity[i] - rocks[i];
    }
    rocksNeeded.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    for (let rocks of rocksNeeded) {
        if (rocks <= additionalRocks) {
            additionalRocks -= rocks;
            count++;
            continue;
        }
        return count
    }
    return count;
};
```

## Reflection

I had an incorrect submission for this problem a few months back due to a TLE so I decided to give it another shot. I was able to code up but what I believe is an optimal `O(nlogn)` time complexity solution.

In retrospect, I could've gotten a better space complexity solution by assigning values inline instead of creating a new array.

Overall, however, this solution is still decent.
