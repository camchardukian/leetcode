## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */

var missingNumber = function(nums) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sum+=i;
        sum-=nums[i]
    }
    sum+=nums.length;
    return sum;
};
```

## Reflection

I think this was pretty much the optimal solution if you weren't able to come up with an expected sum formula on the spot `(n * (n + 1)) / 2` or use bitwise operators.
