## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumDeletions = function (nums) {
    let max = { value: -Infinity, index: undefined };
    let min = { value: Infinity, index: undefined };

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > max.value) {
            max.value = nums[i];
            max.index = i;
        }
        if (nums[i] < min.value) {
            min.value = nums[i];
            min.index = i;
        }
    }

    const fromLeft = Math.max(min.index, max.index) + 1;
    const fromRight = nums.length - Math.min(min.index, max.index);
    const fromBoth = (Math.min(min.index, max.index) + 1) + nums.length - Math.max(min.index, max.index)
    return Math.min(fromLeft, fromRight, fromBoth)
};
```

## Reflection

It took a while to get the optimal solution as at first I tried a two pointer approach. I realized, however, that the two pointer technique wasn't actually necessary once I'd already calculated the indexes.

Instead, I just had to do a few calculations instead.

As a result, the overall time complexity for this solution is `O(n)` as I loop through the array once to get the indexes and them perform some `O(1)` math calculations to get our final answer.
