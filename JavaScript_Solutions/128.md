## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestConsecutive = function (nums) {
    const numSet = new Set(nums)
    const seen = new Set();
    let max = 0;
    let count = 0;

    for (num of nums) {
        count = 1
        if (numSet.has(num - 1)) {
            continue;
        }
        if (seen.has(num)) {
            continue;
        }
        seen.add(num);
        while (true) {
            if (numSet.has(num + 1)) {
                count++;
                num++;
                max = Math.max(max, count)
                continue;
            }
            break;
        }
    }
    max = Math.max(max, count)
    return max;
};
```

## Reflection

I knew the 'trick' to solving this problem, but it still took me several tries to get a successful submission because I wasn't careful enough about edge cases. In particular, I didn't add the second `seen` hashmap because I didn't predict the problem to be so strict about TLE.

In any case, good to solve another medium problem heading into the weekend. We're up to 45 mediums solved, and 225 total problems solved now. Let's keep going.
