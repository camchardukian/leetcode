## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canAliceWin = function (nums) {
    let single = 0;
    let double = 0;
    for (num of nums) {
        if (num > 9) {
            double += num;
        } else {
            single += num;
        }
    }
    return single !== double
};
```

## Reflection

This problem was super straightforward. No need to overanalyze things here.
