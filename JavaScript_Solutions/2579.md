## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var coloredCells = function (n) {
    return n ** 2 + (n - 1) ** 2
};
```

## Reflection

I quickly recognized that the rate of increase between outputs was increasing by 4 each time. In other, I saw between minute 1 and 2 we added 4, and then between minute 2 and 3, we added 8, and then added 12, added 16, added 20 and so on.

So at first I thought the mathematical equation had something to do with the number 4, but I eventually realized it was just adding the current number squared plus the previous number squared.

The reason I tried to solve this problem mathematically was because although a recursion implementation would have worked for my `rate of change increase 4 theory`, such a solution would've quickly become inefficient as our input `n` continued to increase.
