## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} low
 * @param {number} high
 * @return {number}
 */
var countOdds = function(low, high) {
    let oddAddend = 0;
    if (low % 2 || high % 2) {
        oddAddend++;
    }
    return Math.floor((high - low) / 2) + oddAddend
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was efficient, coming in at O(1) time complexity, whereas it would've been O(n) complexity if I manually looped from low to high to count the odd numbers.

I did see one solution that was a bit more concise than mine, however:

```
var countOdds = function(low, high) {
    return Math.floor((high + 1) / 2) - Math.floor(low / 2);
};
```
