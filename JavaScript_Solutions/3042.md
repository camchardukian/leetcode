## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number}
 */
var countPrefixSuffixPairs = function (words) {
    function isPrefixAndSuffix(str1, str2) {
        if (str1 === str2.substring(0, str1.length) && str1 === str2.substring(str2.length - str1.length)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < words.length; j++) {
            if (isPrefixAndSuffix(words[i], words[j])) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

## Reflection

I was able to come up with a brute force solution fairly easily. After further research, however, there is a more optimal solution to this problem using prefix trees sometimes referred to in DSA as "tries".

Unfortunately, to be able to use that type of data structure I'm going to have to learn about trees first. For that reason, the best I can do for this problem at the moment is a brute force solution.

There is a [duplicate of this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-prefix-and-suffix-pairs-ii/description/) that's rated as a LC hard where you're required to solve the problem optimally. Maybe in the future when I get the hang of tries I'll be able to solve that problem.

Anyway, today I accidentally submitted my first solution too early on Leetcode so I completed an extra problem today to continue my streak over on Leetcode. See you tomorrow!
