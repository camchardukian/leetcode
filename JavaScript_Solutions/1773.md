## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[][]} items
 * @param {string} ruleKey
 * @param {string} ruleValue
 * @return {number}
 */
var countMatches = function (items, ruleKey, ruleValue) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let item of items) {
        if ((ruleKey === "type" && item[0] === ruleValue) || (ruleKey === "color" && item[1] === ruleValue) || (ruleKey === "name" && item[2] === ruleValue)) {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

## Reflection

I could refactor the code to make the condition more readable, but as far as performance is concerned things are already optimized.

I chose an easy problem today because yesterday I slept poorly and today my mental clarity is pretty bad.

Even with that being the case, however, I still think it's a good idea to stick to solving one problem every day.

I can continue to get better at string, array, and hashmap problems for now.

When I take a DSA class early next year, however, I'm sure I'll learn more about the different search and sorting techniques and then will have new problems opened up to me to practice solving.
