## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} hours
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget = function(hours, target) {
    let metTarget = 0;
    for (const employee of hours) {
        if (employee >= target) {
            metTarget++;
        }
    }
    return metTarget;
};
```

## Reflection

This was a super straightforward question so I did it using a `for of` loop for practice instead of a normal `for` loop as I rarely use `for of` loops.
