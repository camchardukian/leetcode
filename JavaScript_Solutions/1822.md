## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var arraySign = function (nums) {
    function signFunc(x) {
        if (x === 0) {
            return 0;
        } else if (x > 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        return -1
    }
    return signFunc(nums.reduce((a, b) => {
      const product = a * b
        if (product === 0) {
            return 0;
        } else if (product > 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        return -1
    }, 1))
};
```

## Reflection

My solution worked and was technically optimal from a time solution complexity, but the logic could be simplified.

I manually calculated if products were positive or negative numbers multiple times which works but isn't the performant approach.

Instead, I should've simply looped through the entire array and returned `0` if there were any zeros.

For cases that the input array didn't have any zeros I could simply count the number of negative numbers to see if the end product would be positive or negative.
