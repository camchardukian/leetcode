## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} strs
 * @return {string}
 */
var longestCommonPrefix = function(strs) {
    const sorted = strs.sort();
    let count = 0;
    let length = Math.min(sorted[0].length, sorted[strs.length - 1].length)
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        if (sorted[0][i] === sorted[sorted.length - 1][i]) {
            count++
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    if (!count) {
        return ''
    }
    return sorted[0].substring(0, count)
};
```

## Reflection

While my solution's time complexity wasn't optimal, I think the eloquence of the solution makes up for that in some respects.

Though technically it would have been more efficient to just go letter by letter in all of the strings until there was a mismatch.
