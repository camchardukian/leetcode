## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {character} x
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findWordsContaining = function(words, x) {
    const occurArr = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < words[i].length; j++) {
            if (words[i][j] === x) {
                occurArr.push(i);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return occurArr;
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was fine. I had original planned to use `.indexOf()` or `.includes()` but I saw the hint for the problem suggested to use a for loop so I changed my approach.

On second thought, however, whether we're manually interating as in my case or using a built-in method the performance is probably similar so next time it probably makes sense to just use the built-in method for better readability.
