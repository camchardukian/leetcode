## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var singleNumber = function(nums) {
    return nums.reduce((a, b) => a^b)
};
```

## Reflection

While this problem is solvable using other methods such as a Set or Hashmap, I think using this XOR bitwise operator is the only way to solve the problem using constant space.
