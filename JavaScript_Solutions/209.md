## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} target
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minSubArrayLen = function (target, nums) {
    const prefixSum = new Array(nums.length + 1).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = nums[i] + prefixSum[i]
    }
    let l = 0;
    let r = 0;
    let minLength = nums.length + 1;
    while (r <= prefixSum.length) {
        if (prefixSum[r] - prefixSum[l] >= target) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, r - l);
            l++;
            continue;
        }
        r++;
    }
    if (minLength === nums.length + 1) return 0;
    return minLength;
};
```

## Reflection

I was able to solve this problem in about 25 minutes. At first I tried a pure sliding window solution, but when I realized there didn't seem to be a logical way to decide whether to move the left or right pointer I thought maybe I would need to do some sorting.

However, when I read in the problem description that there was an `O(n)` solution I knew there had to be a better way. After thinking things over for a minute or two, I realized this problem would be a good candidate for prefix sum.

Once I realized that, it just became a matter of writing the code and checking for edge cases.
