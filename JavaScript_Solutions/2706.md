## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @param {number} money
 * @return {number}
 */
var buyChoco = function(prices, money) {

    let min = Infinity
    let min2 = Infinity;
    for (let price of prices) {
        if (price < min2 || price < min) {
            if (price < min) {
              if (min2 >= min) {
                min2 = min;
              }
              min = price
            } else if (price < min2) {
              min2 = price;
            }
        }
    }
    const remainder = money - (min + min2)
    if (remainder >= 0) {
        return remainder;
    }
    return money;
};
```

## Reflection

I quickly identified that the most readable solution for this problem could be produced via sorting.

I also recognized that sorting wouldn't be the most performant because it would be `O(n log n)` and ideally we were looking for an `O(n)` solution.

My solution isn't as readable because of the conditional logic, but it is more optimal in terms of time/space complexity.
