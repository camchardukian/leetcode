## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {number}
 */
var mySqrt = function(x) {
    let min = 0;
    let max = x;
    let mid;
    while (min <= max) {
        mid = Math.floor((min + max)/2);
        const product = mid * mid;
        if (product > x) {
            max = mid - 1;
        } else if (product === x) {
            return mid;
        } else {
            min = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return max;
};
```

## Reflection

This problem was more challenging than the previous binary search problem (704), but still doable. The secret here was realizing that when we have a binary search problem we don't always have to return `mid` or `array[mid]`.

Depending on the problem and what they're looking for, we may need to return min or max or some other related value.
