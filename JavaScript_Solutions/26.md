## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    let l = 0;
    let r = 1;
    while (r < nums.length) {
        if (nums[r] > nums[l]) {
            nums[l + 1] = nums[r];
            l++;
        }
        if (r === nums.length - 1) {
            return l + 1;
        }
        r++;
    }
};
```

## Reflection

I think my solution was pretty optimal except for the unnecessary check of `r === nums.length - 1`. While solving the problem I converted from a for loop to using two explicit pointers in a while loop so I forgot to modify my code with the updated knowledge that I no longer needed to return from within the loop.
