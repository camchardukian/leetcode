## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findErrorNums = function (nums) {
    const bucket = new Array(nums.length).fill(0);
    for (num of nums) {
        bucket[num - 1] = bucket[num - 1] + 1;
    }
    const output = new Array(2);
    for (let i = 0; i < bucket.length; i++) {
        if (bucket[i] === 0) {
            output[1] = i + 1;
        } else if (bucket[i] === 2) {
            output[0] = i + 1
        }
    }
    return output;
};
```

## Reflection

I went back to a problem that stumped me a few months ago and this time was able to solve it fairly quickly using bucket sort. This solution is optimal from a time complexity perspective, but I think there's a slightly more complex solution where you modify the array in place for `O(1)` space complexity instead of `O(n)` space complexity like my solution.

I think I could optimize my solution if I spent a bit more time on it, but I'm satisfied with this solution for now as I have some other things I want to study today as well. See you later.
