## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findDuplicate = function(nums) {
    const numberMap = new Map();
    for (num of nums) {
        if (numberMap.get(num)) {
            return num;
        }
        numberMap.set(num, 1);
    }
};
```

## Reflection

I was proud of myself for having solved the problem in linear time complexity in just a few minutes, but despite my solution being accepted it seems I was wrong about something.

I thought that a `Map` was constant space complexity because I was only creating one map. I thought this because I thought constant space meant linear space, but actually these are two different things.

Now I know better. It seems I should have implemented [Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_tortoise_and_hare).
