## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {string} chars
 * @return {number}
 */
var countCharacters = function (words, chars) {
    let count = 0;
    const letterMap = new Map();
    for (let char of chars) {
        letterMap.set(char, (letterMap.get(char) || 0) + 1);
    }
    for (word of words) {
        for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
            const currentChar = word[i];
            const charFrequency = word.split(currentChar).length - 1
            if (!charFrequency || charFrequency > (letterMap.get(currentChar) || 0)) {
                break;
            }
            if (i === word.length - 1) {
                count += word.length;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

## Reflection

I recognized almost immediately that this problem would need to use a `Map` to be solved efficiently, but it took me many minutes to type out all the syntax correctly.
