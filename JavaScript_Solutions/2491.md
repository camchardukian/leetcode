## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} skill
 * @return {number}
 */
var dividePlayers = function (skill) {
    skill.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let l = 0;
    let r = skill.length - 1;
    const expectedSkill = skill[l] + skill[r];
    let productSum = 0;
    while (l < r) {
        if (skill[l] + skill[r] !== expectedSkill) {
            return -1
        }
        productSum += (skill[l] * skill[r]);
        l++;
        r--;
    }
    return productSum;
};
```

## Reflection

At 1323 ELO, this was another one of those problems that's technically a medium but still feels like an easy.

I did enjoy that this problem combined sorting and two pointers for an `O(n log n)` solution.
