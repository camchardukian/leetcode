## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var searchInsert = function (nums, target) {
    let min = 0;
    let max = nums.length - 1;
    let mid;

    while (min <= max) {
        const mid = Math.floor((min + max) / 2);
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
            max = mid - 1;
        } else {
            min = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return min;
};
```

## Reflection

I got stuck on this problem way longer than necessary because I thought I'd put the final line `return min` outside of the `while` loop but it was actually accidentally nested inside the `while` loop.

Other than that, I think we got another optimal solution and more good practice with binary search.
