## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var arrangeCoins = function(n) {
    let stairs = 1;
    while (n >= stairs) {
        n -= stairs;
        stairs++;
    }
    return stairs - 1;
};
```

## Reflection

I knew there would be some kind of mathematical formula that could solve this problem in a single line, but it seemed too complicated for me to be able to produce it in an interview situation so I just went with the above solution.

The mathematical approach, however, would look something like this:

```
function arrangeCoins(n) {
    return Math.floor(0.5 * (Math.sqrt(8 * n + 1) - 1))
};
```
