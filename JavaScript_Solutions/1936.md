## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} rungs
 * @param {number} dist
 * @return {number}
 */
var addRungs = function (rungs, dist) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = rungs.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const difference = rungs[i] - (rungs[i - 1] || 0);
        if (difference <= dist) {
            continue;
        }
        count += Math.ceil((difference / dist) - 1)
    }
    return count;
};
```

## Reflection

It took me a few tries to get the final syntax down for the rounding we should perform before incrementing `count += Math.ceil((difference / dist) - 1)`, but other than that I felt it was pretty straightforward to come up with an optimal O(n) solution for this problem.
