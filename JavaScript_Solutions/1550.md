## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var threeConsecutiveOdds = function(arr) {
    let count = 0;
    for (num of arr) {
        if (num % 2) {
            count++;
            if (count === 3) return true;
            continue;
        }
        count = 0;
    }
    return false;
};
```

## Reflection

Today I failed at some medium and easy problems so after I couldn't solve the other problems I faced I just did a gimme problem to maintain the habit of solving something everything. This is a simple `O(n)` solution where we solve the problem just by counting any odd numbers that come up and doing an early return of `true` if our count reaches 3 and otherwise returning `false`.
