## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isThree = function(n) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (count > 3) {
            return false;
        }
        if (n % i === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count === 3;
};
```

## Reflection

Initially I tried to see if `n` had a perfect square root, and if that square root had a perfect square root, but then realized that didn't work exactly.

What I should've done was see if `n` had a square root, and if that square root was a prime number.

Unfortunately, I didn't realize that in time and instead did a more naive looping solution.
