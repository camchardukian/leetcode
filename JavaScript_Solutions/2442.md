## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var countDistinctIntegers = function(nums) {
    const arr = [...nums];
    for (num of nums) {
      let reversed = 0;
      let multiplier = Math.pow(10, Math.floor(Math.log10(num)));
      while (num > 0) {
        const addend = num % 10;
        reversed+= (addend * multiplier);
        num = Math.floor(num / 10);
        multiplier/=10;
      }
        arr.push(reversed)
    }
    return new Set(arr).size;
};
```

## Reflection

I had to reference the syntax for `Math.log10` (because I thought I just had to write 'Math.log'), but other than that I was able to come up with an optimal solution all on my own.
