## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var finalString = function(s) {
    let arr = [];
    for (char of s) {
        if (char === 'i') {
            arr.reverse()
        } else {
            arr.push(char)
        }
    }
    return arr.join("");
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was brute force, and I knew that but I didn't want to spend a lot of time for this problem as I want to focus on the calculus course I'm working on. I figured there was probably some way to use a stack or alternate adding to the end or beginning based on some condition and surely enough there is.

Here's a solution that's more optimal than my brute force one:

```
var finalString = function(s) {
    let result = [];
    let reversed = false;

    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === 'i') {
            reversed = !reversed;  // Toggle the reversed flag
        } else {
            if (reversed) {
                result.unshift(char);  // Insert at the front when reversed
            } else {
                result.push(char);  // Append at the back when not reversed
            }
        }
    }

    // If the final string is supposed to be reversed, reverse it once
    if (reversed) {
        result.reverse();
    }

    return result.join('');
};
```
