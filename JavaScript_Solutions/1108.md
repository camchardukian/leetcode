## My solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} address
 * @return {string}
 */
var defangIPaddr = function(address) {
    return address.replaceAll('.', '[.]')
};
```

## Reflection

There are alternative ways of solving this problem such as replacing using regex or splitting and joining, but I think my solution is optimal both from a time/space complexity as well as a readability standpoint.
