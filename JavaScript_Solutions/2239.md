## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findClosestNumber = function(nums) {
    let distance = Infinity;
    let valOfDistance = -Infinity;

    for (num of nums) {
        if (Math.abs(num) < distance) {
            distance = Math.abs(num);
            valOfDistance = num;
        } else if (Math.abs(num) === distance && num > valOfDistance) {
            valOfDistance = num;
        }
    }
    return valOfDistance;
};
```

## Reflection

I put together an optimal O(n) solution for this 'easy' problem in just a few minutes. I spent more than an hour stuck on some medium problems earlier, but wasn't able to put together full working optimal solutions for them.

For that reason, I reviewed better ways to solve those problems and will try those medium level problems again in a week. For now, however, I'm simply tackling an easy problem to maintain momentum and rebuild my confidence a bit.
