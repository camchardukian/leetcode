## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestSubarray = function (nums) {
    let max = 0;
    let l = 0;
    let r = 0;
    let zeros = 0;
    while (r < nums.length) {
        if (nums[r] === 0) {
            zeros++;
            while (zeros > 1) {
                if (nums[l] === 0) {
                    zeros--;
                }
                l++;
            }
            r++;
            continue;
        }
        r++;
        max = Math.max(max, r - l - zeros);
    }
    return Math.min(max, nums.length - 1);
};
```

## Reflection

At a high level, here's what we're doing:

- Loop through the array and expand the window until the window contains 2 zeros.
- When the window contains 2 zeros, move the left edge of window to the right until only 1 zero again.
- Thorughout the entire process keep a variable `max` that's continually updated.
- After we loop through the entire array return Math.min(max, nums.length - 1) because we are forced to delete at least one element.

Of course, that's a vague overview and in reality there are more checks being done. In any case,
