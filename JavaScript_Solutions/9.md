## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPalindrome = function(x) {
    let sum = 0;
    let remaining = x;
    let multiplier = 1;
    while (remaining > 0) {
      sum*=10;
      let addend = remaining % 10;
      sum+=addend;
      remaining = Math.floor(remaining / 10);
    }
    return sum === x;
};
```

## Reflection

I think my solution was solid. I can reliably come up with and write this solution now, but I think I'd still struggle with a clean write (writing the entire solution from start to finish without any bugs or debugging).
