## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var removeStars = function(s) {
    const stack = [];
    for (const char of s) {
      if (char === '*') {
        stack.pop();
      } else {
      stack.push(char);
      }
    }
    return stack.join("")
};
```

## Reflection

This was probably the first time I saw a "medium" problem and immediately knew the optimal solution.

Now this was an easy medium with an ELO difficulty of only 1347, but still a nice feeling.
