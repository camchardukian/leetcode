## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var stringMatching = function (words) {
    const wordsSet = new Set();
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < words.length; j++) {
            if (words[i].includes(words[j])) {
                wordsSet.add(words[j])
            } else if (words[j].includes(words[i])) {
                wordsSet.add(words[i])
            }
        }
    }
    return [...wordsSet];
};
```

## Reflection

After work today I was pretty exhausted. Fortunately, the problem of the day on Leetcode was an easy I hadn't yet solved so I was able to tackle that problem in what I believe to be an optimal `O(n^2*k)` solution where `n` is the size of the input array and `k` is the average length of the strings being compared.

I'm hoping tomorrow I'll have a bit more energy to tackle medium problems again.
