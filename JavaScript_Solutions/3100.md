## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {number} numBottles
 * @param {number} numExchange
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxBottlesDrunk = function (numBottles, numExchange) {
    // numBottles - initial number of water bottles we have
    // numExchange - the number of empty bottles to trade for one full bottle
    // Note: numExchange increases by one after every conversion.
    let emptyBottles = 0;
    let drankBottles = 0;
    if (emptyBottles < numExchange && numBottles === 0) {
        return drankBottles;
    } else if (numBottles) {
        drankBottles += numBottles;
        emptyBottles += numBottles;
        numBottles = 0;
    }
    while (emptyBottles >= numExchange) {
        emptyBottles -= numExchange - 1;
        numExchange++;
        drankBottles++;
    }
    return drankBottles;
};
```

## Reflection

I think my solution was pretty solid except I could have made the `while` loop more efficient by calculating the maximum number of exchangable bottles via division.

This could've been useful to reduce unnecessary looping if for example we had 99 empty bottles and the current `numExchange`.

Overall, however, my solution was still passable considering the modest input constraints.
