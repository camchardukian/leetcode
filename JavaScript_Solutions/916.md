## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} words1
 * @param {string[]} words2
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var wordSubsets = function (words1, words2) {
    const comboCharMap = new Map();
    for (let word of words2) {
        const charMap = new Map;
        for (let char of word) {
            charMap.set(char, (charMap.get(char) || 0) + 1)
            if (charMap.get(char) > (comboCharMap.get(char) || 0)) {
                comboCharMap.set(char, (comboCharMap.get(char) || 0) + 1)
            }
        }
    }

    const output = [];
    for (let word of words1) {
        const charMap = new Map;
        let usedChar = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
            const char = word[i];
            charMap.set(char, (charMap.get(char) || 0) + 1)
            if (charMap.get(char) === comboCharMap.get(char)) {
                usedChar++;
            }
        }
        if (usedChar === comboCharMap.size) {
            output.push(word);
        }
    }
    return output;
};
```

## Reflection

My solution works and seems to be fairly optimal, especially from a time complexity perspective as I only iterate through each character of each input array once.

It might have been more conventional to use an array for counting rather than a map, however, as one of the constraints is that the input arrays contain only lowercase characters.

I also could have used `Math.max()` for conciseness instead of writing my code like this:

```
if (charMap.get(char) > (comboCharMap.get(char) || 0)) {
    comboCharMap.set(char, (comboCharMap.get(char) || 0) + 1)
}
```

Overall, however, I was able to put together a solid solution for a 1624 ELO problem without any outside help so that's encouraging. While solving this problem I also learned that JavaScript Maps copy by reference rather than copying values (shallow vs deep copies), so that was another lesson learned here.
