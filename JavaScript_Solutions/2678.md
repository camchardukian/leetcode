## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string[]} details
 * @return {number}
 */
var countSeniors = function(details) {
    let count = 0;
    for (detail of details) {
        if (Number(detail.substring(11, 13)) > 60) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

## Reflection

It was pretty easy to come up with a solution that was ideal from a time/space complexity standpoint. I don't think any further reflection is really needed for this problem.
