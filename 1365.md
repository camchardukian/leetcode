## My solution

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var smallerNumbersThanCurrent = function(nums) {
    const outputArray = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        outputArray.push(nums.filter((num) => num < nums[i]).length)
    }
    return outputArray;
};
```

## Reflection

I found this problem to be pretty easy to brute force. I didn't know how to use a JS `Map` to solve this problem with a better time complexity, however, because I rarely use Maps. I will try to solve this problem again several days from now using a `Map`.
