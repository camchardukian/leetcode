## My Solution

```
/**
 * @param {string} ransomNote
 * @param {string} magazine
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canConstruct = function(ransomNote, magazine) {
    const letterMap = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < magazine.length; i++) {
        letterMap.set(magazine[i], (letterMap.get(magazine[i]) || 0) + 1)
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < ransomNote.length; i++) {
        const count = letterMap.get(ransomNote[i]) || 0
        if (count >= 1) {
            letterMap.set(ransomNote[i], count - 1)
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true
};
```

## Reflection

My solution was solid, and avoided the potential complexity of having to use different character codes if I would've tried an array based solution.

With that being said, I liked the creativity one of the community members showed with this solution even if it's not the most efficient solution:

```
var canConstruct = function (ransomNote, magazine)
{
    for (const char of magazine)
    {
        ransomNote = ransomNote.replace(char, "");
    }
    if (!ransomNote) return true;
    else return false;
};
```
